🧠 CI-CD Testable — Rails Pipeline Debug & Deployment Sandbox

📌 Overview
This repo was created to test and debug CI/CD pipelines in Ruby on Rails projects. It serves as a sandbox for exploring automated workflows, deployment logic, and integration strategies using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Framework: Ruby on Rails

CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions (planned), Capistrano (optional), Shell scripts

Languages: Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

Testing: RSpec, RuboCop

🚀 Purpose
Simulate CI/CD pipeline behavior in Rails

Test automated deployment triggers and rollback logic

Debug asset precompilation, migrations, and environment variables

Explore GitHub workflow configuration and YAML syntax

📁 Structure Highlights
.github/workflows/: Placeholder for CI/CD workflow files

app/, config/, db/: Standard Rails structure for testing pipeline steps

.rubocop.yml: Linting configuration for code quality enforcement

README.md: Documenting pipeline goals and setup steps

🧪 How to Use
This repo assumes familiarity with:

GitHub Actions or CI/CD tools

Rails deployment flow

Environment setup and secrets management

YAML configuration for workflows

🧠 Reflection
This project helped me explore the intersection of development and delivery, focusing on how Rails apps behave under automated pipelines. It’s a tactical build that reflects my curiosity about DevOps, debugging, and scalable deployment strategies.
