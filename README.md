## 🧠 CI-CD Testable — Rails Pipeline Debug & Deployment Sandbox

### 📌 Overview  
This repo was created to **test and debug CI/CD pipelines** in Ruby on Rails projects. It serves as a sandbox for exploring automated workflows, deployment logic, asset management, and integration strategies using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails  
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions (planned), Capistrano (optional), Shell scripts  
- **Languages**: Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, CSS  
- **Testing & Linting**: RSpec, RuboCop

### 🚀 Purpose  
- Simulate CI/CD pipeline behavior in Rails  
- Test automated deployment triggers and rollback logic  
- Debug asset precompilation, migrations, and environment variables  
- Explore GitHub workflow configuration and YAML syntax

### 📁 Structure Highlights  
- `.github/workflows/`: Placeholder for CI/CD workflow files  
- `app/`, `config/`, `db/`: Standard Rails structure for pipeline testing  
- `.rubocop.yml`: Linting configuration for code quality enforcement  
- `README.md`: Documents pipeline goals and setup steps

### 🧪 How to Use  
This repo assumes familiarity with:
- GitHub Actions or CI/CD workflows  
- Rails deployment flow and asset pipelines  
- Environment setup and secrets management  
- YAML configuration for GitHub workflows

### 🧠 Reflection  
This project helped me explore the **intersection of development and delivery**, focusing on how Rails apps behave under automated pipelines. It sharpened my understanding of GitHub Actions, environment preparation, and CI/CD debugging. It’s a tactical build rooted in my curiosity about DevOps, infrastructure flow, and deployment resilience.
